# Credit-Card-Analysis-Machine-Learning
The following notebook was developed for the Machine Learning course at the Universidad Industrial of Santander as part of the course "DUNTI8 Use of the IT on investigacion"

The notebook contains information about a Credit Card information database (Parameters that could represent it) with the description of the transaction and the amount withdrawal. Is it posible then to find a relation between all these credit cards and a relationship between their transaction, then create a function that tries to predict a possible fraud in a new credit card used.

The aplications could vary from double security checks and police surveillance on the credit card fraud.
